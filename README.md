# Social Distancing and Crowd Monitoring

## Introduction

Social distancing is one of the best practice to prevent spread of the virus by staying at home and away from others. This practice is hard to monitor by human as the limitations in duration of focus and thinking. Monitoring crowd at mall is one of the difficult operation to be done. Two aspects that a mall need to monitor are social distancing practice and controlling the number of people in the building because too many people in building will easily violate the social distancing practice.

## Objectives

For this project, two main objectives need to achieve.

1. To identify people practicing or violating social distancing.
2. To facilitate crowd control by counting the people entering and exiting the premises through a video stream.

## Data Source

The data source of this project is in form of video and converted into frames for image processing operation.

1. Video from Github repository by noumanahmad
2. Video created and recorded from Unity as synthetic data

## Experiments

## Discussion

Throughout the experiment, I found strengths and limitations.
### Strength
1. Fast detection and good performance of object tracking.
2. Can using both video input or input stream from webcam.

### Limitation
1. Required correct angle and high ground to effectively detect and cover large area.
2. Only for entrance or exit usage.
3. Manually manipulate the distance of violation since the app doesn't use any algorithm to map view camera to real distance.
